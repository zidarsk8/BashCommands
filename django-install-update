Installing an official release

1. Download the latest release from our download page.
2. Untar the downloaded file (e.g. tar xzvf Django-NNN.tar.gz
3. Change into the directory created in step 2 (e.g. cd Django-NNN).
4. sudo python setup.py install

Before upgrading uninstall:

If you installed Django using setup.py install, uninstalling is as simple as deleting the django directory from your Python site-packages.

Where are site-packages?

python -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print get_python_lib()"

/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages
